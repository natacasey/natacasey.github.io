I am a language specialist in love with data science who has been working for TuneIn for the past 9 years helping to adapt the product for the international markets. 

I believe in effectiveness of data-driven strategies for decision-making when complying with the privacy and ethics regulations. 

My biggest passion is working with text data.

As a first-generation immigrant I speak several langauges (English, Russian, Belarusian and German) and value cultural awareness and diversity.
