- [Wrangling Marvel Data with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Wrangling_Marvel_Data_with_Python)<br>
The focus of this project is data wrangling using data related to Marvel comic characters. The data comes from three sources: a flat csv file from kaggle.com, ComicVine API, and the website marvel.com. After the three sources are processed using pandas, regex, fuzzy matching, deduplication and other techniques, the dataframes are merged by a character name and loaded into an SQLite database.<br>

- [IMDb Movie Rating EDA Analysis with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/IMDb_Movie_Rating_Analysis_with_Python)<br>
The focus of this project is the EDA analysis of the movie ratings given by users of a movie database IMDb. Hypothesis tests are performed to discover the types of relationships between variables “gross”, “budget”, “votes”, “runtime” and the variable “score”. Hypothesis of scores of horror movies being rated lower vs other genres of movies is tested with the help of CDFs, PMFs, and a chi-square test. The choice of models for analysis is linear regression models.<br>

- [Analysis of the State of Children's Health with Tableau](https://github.com/natacasey/Health_of_Children_of_the_World_with_Tableau)<br>
The focus of the project is to tell a story with the help of Tableau visualizations of the data from UNICEF and WHO which advocates for accelerated improvements in children’s well-being, singles out challenges and roadblocks on the way to a higher health quality, and answers the question of whether we are doing enough in the fight for children’s rights, needs and adequate support.<br>

- [Candy Classification Analysis with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Candy_Classification_with_Python)<br>
The goal of the project is to predict if candy is chocolate or not based on the features included in the Halloween candy data set downloaded from Kaggle. The performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models with tuned hyperparanmeters and feature selection is analyzed to select a final model.<br>

- [Predicting Customer Churn due to Personal Data Use with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Customer_Churn_Prediction_with_Python)<br>
The goal of the project is to create a model whose recall of the positive class is high enough to allow for the successful churn prediction of at least 2/3 of the customers whose personal data is used by businesses. The possible reasons for churning are examined by performing exploratory data analysis. The recommendations for improving the customer relationship and user retention are made.<br>

- [Life Expectancy Prediction with R](https://github.com/natacasey/Life_Expectancy_Prediction_Project_with_R)<br>
Relying on the data put together by WHO and the United Nations, this project examines the hypotheses about the relationships between such factors as education, BMI, population density, expenditure on health, alcohol consumption and the variable life expectancy with the help of multiple regression analysis. Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression models are tested.<br>

- [Weather Report with OpenWeatherMap API Using Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Weather_Report_with_OpenWeatherMap_Using_Python)<br>
The goal of this project is to create a program that gets data from an open API OpenWeatherMap and presents a user with a weather report. The user needs to specify either a zip code or a city to get the results for a specific location. The report can be generated multiple times until a user gives a command to stop the program.<br>

- [Sentiment Analysis with Topic Modeling Using Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Sentiment_Analysis_with_Topic_Modeling_using_Python)<br>
Relying on the data scraped from the Google Play reviews of TuneIn Radio this project examines the overall sentiment of TuneIn Radio, the trends of the sentiment and the aspect-based sentiment of the application with the help of topic modeling with LDA, multiclass calssification models such as logistic regression, CNN, bidirectional LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines.
