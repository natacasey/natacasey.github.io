The focus of this project is wrangling the data related to Marvel comic characters. The data from three sources (a flat csv file, ComicVine API, and the website marvel.com) is processed using pandas, regex, fuzzy matching, deduplication and other techniques, merged and loaded into an SQLite database.<br>
