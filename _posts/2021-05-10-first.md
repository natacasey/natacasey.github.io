The focus of the project is to tell a story with the help of Tableau visualizations which advocates for accelerated improvements in children’s well-being, singles out challenges and roadblocks on the way to a higher health quality, and answers the question of whether we are doing enough in the fight for children’s rights, needs and adequate support.<br>
