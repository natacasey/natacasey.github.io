The goal of [the project](https://github.com/natacasey/Customer_Churn_Prediction_with_Python) is to create a model whose recall of the positive class is high enough to allow for the successful churn prediction of at least 2/3 of the customers whose personal data is used by businesses. The evaluation of 5 classification models shows that the Neural Network Classifier is the best candidate to perform the task well. The possible reasons for churning are examined by performing exploratory data analysis. The recommendations for improving the customer relationship and user retention are made.
