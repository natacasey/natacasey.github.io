- [Word-based Language Identification Pipeline](https://github.com/natacasey/Word-based-Language-Identification-Part-2)
<img src ="images/Pipeline%20(2).png"> <br>
This project focuses on designing a language identification pipeline that can generalize to unseen domains trained over the large comparable corpus. The project proves that pre-processing data while preserving linguistic nuances of the languages plays a significant role in the ability of a language identifier to perform well even on short texts outside the domain.<br>

- [Automatic Identification of Related Languages ](https://github.com/natacasey/Automatic_Identification_of_Related_Languages)
<img src ="images/language.png"> <br>
Relying on the data from the multilingual Amazon reviews corpus this project focuses  on creating a language detector that is capable of recognizing the related languages of English, German, Spanish and French. Informative linguistic features of each of the related languages mentioned above, different text data preprocessing techniques, and such supervised models as Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Suppport Vector Machines, and a bidirectional LSTM are used in this project to create a pipeline capable of successfully identifying these languages. <br>

- [Sentiment Analysis with Topic Modeling Using Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Sentiment_Analysis_with_Topic_Modeling_using_Python)<br>
<img src ="images/sentimentan.png"> <br>
Relying on the data scraped from the Google Play reviews of TuneIn Radio this project examines the overall sentiment of TuneIn Radio, the trends of the sentiment and the aspect-based sentiment of the application with the help of topic modeling with LDA, multiclass classification models such as Logistic Regression, CNN, bidirectional LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines.<br>

- [Wrangling Marvel Data with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Wrangling_Marvel_Data_with_Python)<br>
<img src ="images/marvel.png"><br>
The focus of this project is wrangling the data related to Marvel comic characters. The data from three sources (a flat csv file, ComicVine API, and the website marvel.com) is processed using pandas, regex, fuzzy matching, deduplication and other techniques, merged and loaded into an SQLite database.<br>

- [IMDb Movie Rating EDA Analysis with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/IMDb_Movie_Rating_Analysis_with_Python)<br>
<img src ="images/movie.png"> <br>
The focus of this project is the EDA analysis of the movie ratings given by users of a movie database IMDb. Hypothesis tests are performed to discover the types of relationships between such factors as gross revenue, budget, number of votes and rating scores. The choice of models for analysis is linear regression models.<br>

- [Analysis of the State of Children's Health with Tableau](https://github.com/natacasey/Health_of_Children_of_the_World_with_Tableau)<br>
<img src ="images/children.png"> <br>
The focus of the project is to tell a story with the help of Tableau visualizations which advocates for accelerated improvements in children’s well-being, singles out challenges and roadblocks on the way to a higher health quality, and answers the question of whether we are doing enough in the fight for children’s rights, needs and adequate support.<br>

- [Candy Classification Analysis with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Candy_Classification_with_Python)<br>
<img src ="images/candies.png"> <br>
The goal of the project relying on Halloween Candy dataset is to predict if candy is chocolate or not. The performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models with tuned hyperparanmeters and feature selection is analyzed to select a final model.<br>

- [Predicting Customer Churn due to Personal Data Use with Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Customer_Churn_Prediction_with_Python)<br>
<img src ="images/churn.png"> <br>
The goal of the project is to create a model whose recall of the positive class is high enough to allow for the successful churn prediction of at least 2/3 of the customers whose personal data is used by businesses. The possible reasons for churning are examined by performing exploratory data analysis. The recommendations for improving the customer relationship and user retention are made.<br>

- [Life Expectancy Prediction with R](https://github.com/natacasey/Life_Expectancy_Prediction_Project_with_R)<br>
<img src ="images/lifeexcpect%20(1).png"> <br>
Relying on the data put together by WHO and the United Nations, this project examines the hypotheses about the relationships between such factors as education, BMI, population density, expenditure on health, alcohol consumption and the variable life expectancy with the help of multiple regression analysis. Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression models are tested.<br>

- [Weather Report with OpenWeatherMap API Using Python](https://github.com/natacasey/Weather_Report_with_OpenWeatherMap_Using_Python)<br>
<br>
<img src ="images/weathertrans.png"> <br>
The goal of this project is to create a program that gets data from an open API OpenWeatherMap and presents a user with a weather report. The user needs to specify either a zip code or a city to get the results for a specific location. The report can be generated multiple times until a user gives a command to stop the program.<br>
